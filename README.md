A visually immersive, animation-rich clone of the XDC Network website, built with precision, modularity, and narrative-driven UI elements. This project showcases how modern web animation can elevate storytelling, using scroll-triggered reveals, symbolic motifs, and viewport-aware transitions.

## 🎬 Animation Philosophy

This site isn't just animated — it's **cinematic**. Every motion is intentional, every reveal symbolic. Inspired by filmic pacing and narrative rhythm, the animations guide the user through a journey rather than a scroll.

### 🔧 Animation Tools & Techniques

- **React + Tailwind CSS** for component structure and styling
- **CSS Keyframes** for multi-phase motion sequences
- **Framer Motion** for physics-based transitions and scroll awareness
- **Custom Easing Curves** (`cubic-bezier`) for slow-start, fast-finish effects
- **Intersection Observer API** for viewport-triggered logic
- **SVG Symbolism** for anchor-inspired arrows and sunrise reveals

## 🌀 Types of Animations

| Animation Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Per-letter text reveal**     | Bottom-to-top staggered motion with cinematic pacing                        |
| **Scroll-triggered fades**     | Sections fade and slide in only when visible                                |
| **Button morphing**            | Hero CTA button animates with hover and entry transitions                   |
| **Symbolic SVG transitions**   | Arrows and icons animate with narrative intent                              |
| **Layered stacking reveals**   | Sections emerge without overlap, regardless of future content changes       |

## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Viewport-triggered timing**
**Challenge:** Ensuring animations only trigger when elements are fully visible  
**Solution:** Used `IntersectionObserver` with precise thresholds and fallback logic for mobile devices

### 2. **Per-letter reveal without horizontal sweep**
**Challenge:** Avoiding default left-to-right animation bias  
**Solution:** Built custom keyframes for vertical motion and staggered delays using `nth-child` selectors

### 3. **Layout robustness**
**Challenge:** Preventing section overlap with dynamic content  
**Solution:** Designed a future-proof stacking context using `z-index`, `position`, and modular spacing logic

### 4. **Symbolic motion**
**Challenge:** Making SVG icons feel meaningful, not decorative  
**Solution:** Anchored motion to narrative metaphors — e.g., arrows that “pull” the user forward, sunrise reveals that “awaken” the next section
